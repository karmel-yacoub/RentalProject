    he need to make the registration process to have his data and the needed informations to display the available houses.
 
  ..The project contains 11 JSP pages and 1 css(style sheet),all the pages are responsive.
 
  ..Validation is available for password as the email do also, if the user not registered, he could register and use the website as he wants.
 
  ..The backend is done with Java_Language by the spring-boot,, and we linked the models with many relationships these are between many to many and one to many.
 
  ..The project is built within 2 days as frontend and 4 days as backend using the admin page,we built the routes in the controllers and the services packages and the models 
    in the models packages,it is also opened for enhancements and updates.
    
  .. We used API'S in the search-bar to find all the the countries in the world and another one in the email verification it sends you an email to verify your registration process
